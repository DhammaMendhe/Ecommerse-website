          An ecommerce website is a digital platform that enables the buying and
          selling of goods or services over the internet. These websites provide
          a virtual marketplace where businesses and consumers can engage in
          transactions without the need for physical interaction. Typically, an
          ecommerce website includes features such as product listings, shopping
          carts, secure payment gateways, and order management systems.
